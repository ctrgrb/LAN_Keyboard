# LAN_Keyboard
Control a device on your LAN by sending keyboard strokes through a UPD socket (unencrypted).
Run python server.py on the machine you want to control and virtual_keyboard.py (client) on the machine you would like to control from. Best result when the client side has touchscreen. Best result when pairing with https://github.com/Unrud/remote-touchpad
